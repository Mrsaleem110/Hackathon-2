## Prompt
Setup specification-driven development structure for phase 2 using Claude Code and SpecKit Plus.

## Response
Created the necessary directory structure and specification files for phase 2, including spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md, constitution.md, and PHR templates.

## Outcome
Specification structure successfully implemented following SDD methodology. All required files created with proper content reflecting phase 2 requirements and implementation approach.

## Evaluation
The specification-driven development structure is properly set up, demonstrating use of Claude Code and SpecKit Plus as required. The implementation follows the methodology outlined in CLAUDE.md.
