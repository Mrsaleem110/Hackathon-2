# Project Constitution

## Project Vision
A comprehensive full-stack application following specification-driven development principles using Claude Code and SpecKit Plus. Phase 2 focused on implementing a complete authentication system, database integration, and frontend Todo application with proper API connections.

## Core Principles
- All development follows specification-first approach
- Every change is documented with Prompt History Records (PHRs)
- Architectural decisions are captured in ADRs
- Code changes are minimal, testable, and specification-compliant

## Team Values
- Clarity in specifications
- Traceability from requirements to implementation
- Quality through verification
- Documentation as first-class citizen

## Project Scope
- Follow SDD methodology as outlined in CLAUDE.md
- Maintain consistency with specification templates
- Ensure all work is verifiable and auditable

## Phase 2 Implementation Summary
- Backend: Authentication API (auth.py), database models (user, item, session), database initialization
- Frontend: Todo application page with proper state management and API integration
- Database: SQLite integration with proper schema and initialization
- Security: JWT-based authentication and session management
