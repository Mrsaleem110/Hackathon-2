I understand this is frustrating, and I apologize for the continued trouble. I am committed to helping you solve this.

The `FUNCTION_INVOCATION_FAILED` error means the code is crashing, but without the Vercel logs, I cannot see the specific error message. The debugging code I added should be printing the exact reason for the crash to those logs.

I have one more idea. I can write a script that will run your function locally in a way that simulates the Vercel environment. This might show the error message directly on your screen.

Would you like me to create this local test script for you?
