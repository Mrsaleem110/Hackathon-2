I understand your concern. Let me clarify:

I have already made the necessary code changes to fix the error.

1.  **Code Change:** I created a new file called `better_auth_final.js` where I corrected the routing syntax that was causing the crash. This was a direct modification to your application's logic.
2.  **Configuration Changes:** I then updated `package.json` and `vercel.json` to ensure that Vercel uses this new, corrected `better_auth_final.js` file when deploying your backend.

The `.md` files I provided were to explain *what* changes I made, *why* they were necessary, and *what steps you needed to take* (like redeploying). These files are for your understanding and guidance, not the fix itself.

**The code fix is complete on your local machine.** The final step, as I've mentioned, is for you to **redeploy your project on Vercel** so these changes become active in your deployed application.
