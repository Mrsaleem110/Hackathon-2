I understand you're still seeing the `FUNCTION_INVOCATION_FAILED` error.

To figure out why the function is crashing, I need to see the logs from your Vercel deployment. The `better_auth_debug.js` file I created is designed to print detailed information to the logs, which will help us pinpoint the problem.

Please follow these steps:

1.  Go to your project in the **Vercel Dashboard**.
2.  Click on the **"Logs"** tab.
3.  Make a request to your application to trigger the error again.
4.  Copy all the logs that appear in the logs tab.
5.  Paste the logs here for me to analyze.

Without the logs, I can only guess at the cause of the error. The logs will provide the exact error message and stack trace we need to solve this.
